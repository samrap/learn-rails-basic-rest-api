# A basic RESTful API written in Ruby

The purpose of this repository is to build a RESTful API in Rails as practice for becoming more familiar with Ruby and the Rails framework in particular.

## The Application

The API will provide basic CRUD functionality for managing an online library of books. Routes should be protected with OAUTH and the API should be built using TDD.

## Project Goals

The following goals should be achieved upon completion of this API:

- Take the Rails "Getting Started" guide to the next level by using the knowledge obtained [by following the guide](https://github.com/samrap/rails-blog) to create a more robust project.
- Establish a better understanding of the framework end-to-end
- Become familiar with the Minitest testing framework
- Discover some "rubyisms" encouraged by Rails
- Become more well-rounded in Ruby itself

Since both Ruby and Rails are brand-new to me at this point, I decided to use Rails as an accelerated introduction to Rails. While I understand jumping straight into a framework before learning the language can have negative effects, I feel it is the best approach for learning Ruby best-practices, especially with the various tools and conventions of a large project.
